Some sketchy notes on Korma

------------------------------------
You need a config file in the target repo:  korma_config.yml

It looks like this:


    title: Ruby Best Practices
    domain: blog.rubybestpractices.com
    description: Increase your productivity -- Write Better Code
    authors:
      gregory: Gregory Brown
      JEG2: James Edward Gray II
      jia: Jia Wu
      jamesbritt: James Britt
      laktek: Lakshan Perera
      rklemme: Robert Klemme


It's yaml, of course.  


------------------------------------
You will not see an 'about' file for an author until that author has at least one post.


------------------------------------
You have to commit your changes to the target repo for Korma to see them.


------------------------------------
For a live site you may want to have a post-commit hook call into your instance of Korma to regenerate the pages

For example:


  #!/bin/sh
  #
  # An example hook script that is called after a successful
  # commit is made.
  #
  # To enable this hook, make this file executable.

  /usr/local/bin/ruby /home/james/data/vendor/korma/korma.rb /home/james/data/vendor/jgb-rbp-blog /home/james/data/vendor/korma/www


Be sure to make it executable!

   chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit


------------------------------------

korma.rb takes two arguments. THe first is required; it is the path to the git repo with your blog content.

The second is the output directory.  You can omit this, and Korma will default to 'www'. But know that this is relative;
if you are not careful you may end up with 'www/' in the blog repo.  (But maybe this is what you want.)

-------------------------------------

The bulk of the work is done via Grit, which finds the stuff we care about and hands it off for rendering.

A key Grit method is '/', which does a search for a given item, and returns either the item (if it refers to
a file) or  "blob" (if the results are a directory).
